title: "Repeating last command-line with `@:`"
---

Once you've used Vim for a while you become accustomed to repeating the last change in normal mode with `.`. Being able to repeat actions easily lends itself to some efficient workflows and Vim also provides a way of repeating the last command-line action from normal mode using `@:`.

I find `@:` useful to repeat commands such as `:cn` / `:cp` to navigate the quickfix list, `:bd` to easily close a bunch of files and to repeat the last substitution.

See `:help @:` for more.
