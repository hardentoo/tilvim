title: Fuzzy finding with FZF.vim
---

I've been through my fair share of Vim file finding plugins. I first started with Command-T before moving on to CtrlP. I then stole a colleague's set up which used Gary Bernhardt's [selecta](https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta) finder. [You can find the config for that in my old vimrc](https://github.com/jackfranklin/dotfiles/blob/dad7546b3b558900d1b1069c52399a49cbc4c7b6/vim/vimrc#L207).

That had been serving me well but I then stumbled upon Junegunn Choi's excellent [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), a great fuzzy finder that (from my experience so far) seems incredibly quick and extremely reliable. Thankfully he's also created [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim), a Vim wrapper around some common functionality that fzf provides. It's this that I want to show you today.

Installing is fairly straight forward, and it's recommended you use [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to do it:

```
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'dir': '~/.fzf', 'do': './install --all' }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
```

Once done you'll have access to a bunch of new commands that will use fzf to find files, lines and more.

## Finding Files

You can use the `:Files` command to search for files in your directory.

## Finding Commits

I'm also a big fan of the `:Commits` command, which fuzzy searches through your git commits. Note that you need Fugitive.vim for this to work.

## Matching Lines

You can also use the plugin in insert mode to perform linewise completition based on what you've already typed! I've mapped this like so:

```
imap <c-x><c-l> <plug>(fzf-complete-line)
```

As shown in the fzf.vim README. This is really useful when you need to type a line you know you've typed before - for example, an import or require statement. This is effectively Vim's linewise completion on overdrive!

## Conclusion

fzf.vim has really added a lot to my Vim setup and workflow - once you get used to fuzzy finding everything you'll never look back, and I highly recommend giving it a go.
